Hello interviewers, my name is Yang Lian. I would like to give a brief introduction about myself. I completed my undergraduate studies at Guangdong University of Technology, majoring in Automation, and then continued my education at Hunan University for a Master's degree in Electronic Information. I am currently in my second year of graduate studies and will graduate next year.

During my undergraduate studies, I participated in various competitions, achieving awards such as the First Prize in the National College Students' Mathematical Modeling Contest of Guangdong Province, Second Prize in the Guangdong Provincial College Students' Electronic Design Competition, and First Prize in the National College Students' Robot Contest Robocon.

**比赛**

One significant competition was the National College Students' Robot Contest Robocon, where I was a core member of the electrical control team. The competition required teams to independently design two mobile robots; one robot moved to a designated position to pick up a rugby ball and then launched it to another robot, which would carry it to a designated position for placement. My responsibilities included using IMU and orthogonal encoders to build a positioning system for the entire field, updating the positioning with a laser rangefinder to eliminate cumulative errors, calculating the forward and inverse kinematics for an 8-degree-of-freedom steering wheel chassis, planning trajectories with cubic B-spline curves and testing on the V-REP simulation platform, and collaborating with the circuit team to write embedded code on an STM32 development board to test various robot sensors, drivers, and actuators. We won the national first prize in this competition.

Another important competition was the Robocon "Equestrian Robot Simulation Contest," which I was fully responsible for. The competition's objective was to complete various gaits and jumping hurdle operations of a quadruped robot on a three-dimensional physical simulation platform. My tasks included using Solidworks to define the coordinate transformation relationships between the joints based on the mechanical model of the quadruped robot, exporting its URDF file, calculating the forward and inverse kinematics and attitude solving principles of a 12-degree-of-freedom quadruped robot, and testing with V-REP and Matlab. I also implemented various gaits and hurdle jumping tests using the VMC algorithm on the V-REP simulation platform, achieving a national second prize. As a course creator and lecturer, I published two courses related to quadruped robots, "Introduction to Quadruped Robot Simulation" and "VMC Algorithm Simulation Implementation," in the Guyueju Robot Community, accumulating over 1000 subscriptions to date.

**实习**

After completing my undergraduate degree, I interned for six months in the autonomous driving department at DJI, working as an embedded software development intern. In the first two months, I was mainly responsible for the forward development of the L2+ Intelligent Driving Assistance System, performing software unit forward development based on the ASPICE software development model, and carrying out software requirement analysis, architecture design, detailed design, unit testing, integration testing, and compliance testing. In the following four months, I developed a human-machine interaction logic model for autonomous driving vehicles using Matlab's MBD toolchain, automatically generating HMI code, compiling code packages for on-vehicle functionality testing, and debugging bus signals with CANoe.

**os**

During my graduate studies, I worked on two main projects. The first was using Qemu to create an embedded Riscv64 operating system, implementing a simple operating system kernel. This project is a C language version of rCore, originally written in Rust for a Riscv64 operating system. My specific tasks were:

- Defining an RV64 SOC with Qemu's built-in interface, including hardware like Flash, PLIC, CLINT, RTC, UART, and containing eight cores.
- Writing a device tree file for the SOC, porting OpenSBI, and writing the startup assembly code to run in Flash to load firmware for execution in DRAM.
- Using OpenSBI for security domain and non-security domain division, with the non-security domain running my written kernel.
- Implementing a stack-based data structure to manage and allocate physical memory pages, implementing a time-sharing multitasking scheduling mechanism based on RTC interrupts.
- Implementing virtual to physical address mapping for processes and the kernel using RISCV's sv39 paging mechanism, with the kernel using identity mapping.
- Designing an application loading mechanism, traversing process binary folders, generating process assembly symbols, and loading process data through incbin.
- Implementing common system calls like fork, exec, read, write, etc., launching a user_shell process at system startup.
- Running S-state FreeRTOS in the security domain, porting the system based on the FreeRTOS porting framework, and writing port-related source files such as task context switching assembly and soft interrupt-triggered scheduling.

**中间件**

The second project developed a C++ software similar to the ROS2 robot operating system, implementing a publish-subscribe communication model for efficient communication between robot algorithm modules and execution modules, supporting both shared memory and network communication modes. My specific tasks included:

- Using atomic variables and CAS operations to implement common basic components such as lock-free queues and lock-free hash tables.
- Designing a serialization protocol supporting basic data types, composite data types, and custom data types for serialization and deserialization.
- Implementing a simple logging system supporting dynamic log levels, automatic file rotation, and a streaming interface, using the RAII mechanism for accumulated log writing.
- Using a directed graph to build communication topology, with Nodes as graph vertices and data channels as graph edges, implementing decentralized broadcasting for joining and leaving.
- Designing a signal-slot mechanism using the observer pattern, binding slot functions to subscribed data channels at the subscriber end, and implementing callbacks through the signal-slot mechanism.

This concludes my educational and project experience.
